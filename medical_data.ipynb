        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook provides utilities and functions related to medical data processing. It makes use of various libraries and requires specific configurations to run correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Initial Setup\n",
        "Before executing the main code, it's crucial to set up the environment correctly. This ensures smooth functioning and avoids dependency-related issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Required Packages:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install llama-index\n",
        "!pip install Ipython\n",
        "!pip install pypdf\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Imports\n",
        "The notebook requires several Python libraries and modules. These libraries provide essential functionalities used throughout the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Libraries and Modules:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "import sys\n",
        "from llama_index import ...\n",

        "\n",
        "(Note: The ellipsis (`...`) is a placeholder indicating additional items. Refer to the original code for a complete list.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Configuration\n",
        "Once the environment is set up and all required modules are imported, some configurations need to be made. These are essential for connecting to external services and ensuring the code runs as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "### OpenAI Configuration:\n",
        "To utilize the OpenAI services, input your API key when prompted:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "openai.api_key=getpass(\"Enter your OAI key: \")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Token Counter Configuration:\n",
        "This configuration is essential for managing and counting tokens during processing.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "token_counter = TokenCountingHandler(...)\n",
        "callback_manager = CallbackManager([token_counter])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Main Functionality\n",
        "This section contains the core operations of the notebook. While the code is extensive, a brief overview is provided below:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "...\n",
        "#load documents\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "(Note: This is a concise summary. For detailed operations, refer to the notebook directly.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "1. Begin with the initial setup to ensure all dependencies are installed.\n",
        "2. Follow with the imports section.\n",
        "3. Proceed with the configuration, ensuring you have your OpenAI API key.\n",
        "4. Execute the main functionality sections sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Additional Notes\n",
        "- Always ensure you have the latest versions of libraries to avoid compatibility issues.\n",
        "- Secure your OpenAI API key and do not expose it in shared or public environments.\n",
        "- For extensive data operations, consider monitoring resource usage to avoid potential system slowdowns.\n",

Lea esta información detenidamente con el consentimiento \\ninformado principal y haga todas las preguntas que tenga. Si lo desea, puede hablar con otras \\npersonas, como su médico de cabecera, sobre su posible continuación.  \\n \\nSe le pide que  otorgue un consentimiento adicional para continuar recibiendo el (los) mismo(s) \\nfármaco(s) que ha estado recibiendo en este estudio clínico, porque sus tumores han \\naumentado de tamaño o ha desarrollado nuevos tumores mientras recibía el fármaco del \\nestudi o. Este aumento en el tamaño del tumor puede representar una verdadera progresión de \\nla enfermedad o podría representar una primera respuesta al tratamiento del estudio, que se \\ncaracteriza por una inflamación o agrandamiento de su tumor.  \\n \\nCon este formula rio de consentimiento, se le pregunta si desea continuar con el tratamiento con \\nlos fármacos del estudio durante un periodo adicional máximo de 4 -8 semanas, momento en el \\nque se volverá a explorar el tamaño de su(s) tumor(es). Si su tumor no ha respondido en ese \\nmomento, se confirmará que el cáncer no está respondiendo al tratamiento de este estudio y \\ndejará de recibir tratamiento en este estudio. Si su tumor ha respondido (es decir, se ha \\nreducido el tamaño), se le permitirá continuar recibiendo tratamient o en este estudio.  \\n \\nDado que no se puede estar seguro de si el aumento del tamaño del tumor representa una \\nrespuesta inicial al tratamiento o la progresión real de la enfermedad, es posible que la decisión \\nde someterse al tratamiento más allá de la progres ión signifique que se retrasará el inicio de \\notro tratamiento que podría ser eficaz para tratar su enfermedad. Además, usted puede tener \\nefectos secundarios, posiblemente graves o potencialmente mortales, al continuar el \\ntratamiento del estudio. Su médico le comentará el tratamiento aprobado y las opciones de \\ntratamiento experimental disponibles para su tipo de cáncer, de manera que pueda decidir si el \\ntratamiento más allá de la progresión es adecuado para usted. No firme este consentimiento si \\nusted no ha tenido esta conversación con su médico del estudio.

Este anexo no repite la información contenida en el formulario de consentimiento \\ninformado (FCI) princ ipal de este estudio. Antes de que decida si quiere seguir con el(los) \\nmismo(s) fármaco(s) del estudio, es importante que entienda por qué se realiza la \\ninvestigación, qué implicará la continuación, los posibles beneficios, riesgos y molestias, y \\ncómo se u sará su información. Lea esta información detenidamente con el consentimiento \\ninformado principal y haga todas las preguntas que tenga. Si lo desea, puede hablar con otras \\npersonas, como su médico de cabecera, sobre su posible continuación.  \\n \\nSe le pide que  otorgue un consentimiento adicional para continuar recibiendo el (los) mismo(s) \\nfármaco(s) que ha estado recibiendo en este estudio clínico, porque sus tumores han \\naumentado de tamaño o ha desarrollado nuevos tumores mientras recibía el fármaco del \\nestudi o.

Además, usted puede tener \\nefectos secundarios, posiblemente graves o potencialmente mortales, al continuar el \\ntratamiento del estudio. Su médico le comentará el tratamiento aprobado y las opciones de \\ntratamiento experimental disponibles para su tipo de cáncer, de manera que pueda decidir si el \\ntratamiento más allá de la progresión es adecuado para usted.
